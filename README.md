# Fake-Currency-Detection-
A machine learning project that detects counterfeit currency notes using logistic regression. The model analyzes various features of currency notes to classify them as genuine or fake, helping in automating fraud detection. Implemented in Python with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for accurate predictions.


## Project Overview
This project focuses on applying machine learning to a real-world financial problem. The model is trained on extracted statistical features of currency notes and predicts authenticity using Logistic Regression.

The goal is to demonstrate the complete ML pipeline:  
data preprocessing → model training → evaluation → prediction.

## Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature analysis and visualization  
- Model training using Logistic Regression  
- Accuracy and performance evaluation  
- Prediction on unseen inputs  

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Machine Learning Workflow
1. Dataset understanding and preprocessing  
2. Feature-target separation  
3. Train-test split  
4. Model training using Logistic Regression  
5. Model evaluation using accuracy score  
6. Testing model on new data  

## Use Case
This project demonstrates how ML can be applied in banking and finance systems for detecting counterfeit currency and can be extended to real-world applications with image processing.

## How to Run
```bash


## Dataset
Dataset is too large for GitHub.
